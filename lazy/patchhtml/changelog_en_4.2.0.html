    <h1 class="mume-header" id="important-enhancements">4.2.0 Important enhancements (1/1/2023)</h1>

    <h2 class="mume-header" id="improved-criticalbotch-roll-tables">Improved critical/botch roll tables</h2>

    <p>A large chunk of the roll tables for critical and botch rolls is now automated. This includes functions for
        damaged gear, lost gear, resistable effects, mali and boni, and all kinds of unwanted accidents and their
        painful results. The base system already includes a few of those tables, while all the remaining tables are part
        of the compendium 2, which will get its update for this function soon, too.</p>
    <h2 class="mume-header" id="refactor">Refactor</h2>

    <p>The switch to Foundry 10 has been a tremendous amount of work (almost like a complete rewrite of the system).
        Along this refactoring we also changed a lot of our own functions to improve and lay the way for new
        possibilities and capabilities of the TDE/DSA system in the future.</p>
    <h2 class="mume-header" id="general-overhauled-conditions-system">General overhauled conditions system</h2>

    <p>The conditions system has been overhauled a bit. There is now a new section on the status tab of the character
        sheet, labeled &quot;cumulative effects&quot;. This section can combine status effects of different sources.
        E.g. two levels of pain lost through suffered damage + another one coming from a pain inflicting spell or
        similar things. This improvement allows to add a duration for all such effects. So the spell effect can fade
        after x amount of combat rounds while the pain from the damage remains (each level of pain can fade at a
        different time). We will try to update all existing automations for such effects where possible.</p>
    <h2 class="mume-header" id="mounted-combat">Mounted combat</h2>

    <p>The rules for mounted combat (wiihiiihi) found their way into TDE/DSA for foundry. It&apos;s a more complex
        function and might require some time to learn it. So hope for a video by VTTom &#x1F603;</p>
    <p>Current possibilities include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Select two tokens, open the token HUD of the rider and press the mount button to jump on a horse</li>
        <li>Drag a horse onto the riders sheet to set it as horse</li>
        <li>The rider will have the speed and base initiative of the horse</li>
        <li>Archers on horse get the speed modifier set automatically</li>
        <li>Riders have the skill &quot;Riding&quot; and &quot;Loyalty&quot; of their horse always in their tokenhotbar
            if they are currently riding</li>
        <li>Riders gain the advantageous position against non riders automatically</li>
        <li>If your rider has a horse connected and is currently riding it, then the horse token will be placed on the
            map too, each time you create a new rider token.</li>
        <li>Make sure to mark the actorLink for named horses of your heros, as unlinked horses behave slightly different
        </li>
        <li>Move the rider token around the map and the horse will follow</li>
        <li>The Z-index sometimes might flip. In this case draw a select box around the rider-horse pair and both tokens
            swap their z-Index (other token comes to the front, currently no good fix known)</li>
        <li>Set the speed or gear of the horse via the token HUD of the rider or the character sheet. Setting the speed
            is intended for the automatic calculation of charged attacks and the like</li>
        <li>Some special abilities for mounted combat will be improved soon, so they do what they should do. Don&apos;t
            forget to migrate your actors at that time.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Things currently not implemented that might come in the future:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Automatic riding roll if horse suffers damage points</li>
        <li>Automatic riding roll if horse slows down</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please let us know, if you are missing something else for a smooth horsy playing experience.<br>
        Also checkout the &quot;Tiergef&#xE4;hrten&quot; (german only) module for a bunch of beautiful horses and other
        riding companions.</p>
    <h1 class="mume-header" id="enhancements">Enhancements</h1>

    <p>Some of these have already been rolled out with recent hotfix patches.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Liturgical chants are now available via the token hotbar out of combat (4.1.1)</li>
        <li>Token name obfuscation not executed for player characters anymore (4.1.10)</li>
        <li>The resizer of the tokenhotbar and TDE initiative tracker now shows a tooltip explaining all options
            (4.1.10)</li>
        <li>Melee attacks now include the size modifiers of creatures (mostly very tiny creatures) (4.1.10)</li>
        <li>Attack trait&apos;s can now have active effects which are applied to the target similar to meleeweapons
            (e.g. one level of pain on hit) (4.1.10)</li>
        <li>The token obfuscation (rename) function now always also shows a button to rename the token to
            &quot;unknown&quot; (4.1.11)</li>
        <li>Npc&apos;s can now have cummulative checks on their sheets (e.g. a smith building a complicated weapon)
            (4.1.15)</li>
        <li>An attack chat card now shows if the weapon has been held with the wrong grip (e.g. a two-handed weapon with
            one hand) (4.1.17)</li>
        <li>Images can now be posted to the chat from the image artwork viewer so players can revisit and open recent
            riddle/theatre of mind/actor artworks. (4.1.17)</li>
        <li>The master menu now also has the request check functionality (4.1.17)</li>
        <li>A merchant&apos;s money can now be hidden from the players (so they stop thinking of robbing every merchant)
            (4.1.17)</li>
        <li>Active effects which modify the initiative now do this automatically. No manual edit of the combat tracker
            necessary anymore. Especially useful with automatic decay of effects via the module &quot;times-up&quot;.
            Axxeleratus is now perfect! (4.1.17)</li>
        <li>Group fatepoints are now visible on character sheets (4.1.19)</li>
        <li>Active effects can now alter the modifications of of spell modifiers like force, reduce cost, increase cost,
            remove gesture, remove formula, increase range, decrease range, increase casting time, decrease casting
            time. You can find the new keys in the active effects dropdown. This is especially useful for traditions and
            spell extensions and will be added to all existing specialabilities sometime soon.</li>
        <li>Spell extensions can now enable the modifiers for increase and decrease castingtime</li>
        <li>Traditions from official modules are going to set the guidevalue for AE/KE automatically soon</li>
        <li>The LE can now be modified on tokens to a negative value also for characters and npcs (dying rule)</li>

            modules</li>
        <li>Active effects on weapons apply their effect by default to the target of an attack (e.g. to add additional
            pain). Now they can additionally contain effects which are applied to the bearer of the weapon. To do so
            check the corresponding checkbox on the active effects configuration. You can create e.g. now a cursed
            weapon which applies one level of fear to the bearer of the weapon and one level of stun to all targets in
            combat.</li>
        <li>The Dere Positioning System (DPS) can now be configured per scene also. Find the setting on the grid tab of
            the scene config. You can now disable or enable the range check for special scenes.</li>
        <li>There is now an active effect for increased soulpower or toughness vs. spells (we will add this to existing
            abilities whenever there is time to do so)</li>
        <li>The attack dialog shows now a small indicator for offhand weapons</li>
        <li>The target weapon range detection no always uses the largest equipped weapon instead of the first one</li>
        <li>The measure template for cone spell effects now also contains a field for the angle</li>
    </ul>
