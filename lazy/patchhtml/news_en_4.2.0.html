    <p>DSA in foundry shines as it allows any user to use very complicated rules and pros can get just a little more
        edge on everything. Thanks to Ulisses Spiele and all previous contributors to TDE/DSA we were able to create a
        very sophisticated system, which faciliates easy up to very complicated rules, so everyone can concentrate on
        amazing storyplay without too much hurdles, so we can all enjoy a big story be it casual or super deep into
        endless years of TDE/DSA history.<br>
        Feeling the story was never so easy, all bureaucracy taken away by the system. Just play your character and get
        rid of all &quot;damn, how is this supposed to work again?&quot; cases.<br>
        TDE/DSA on foundry especially profits from a rich load of functions that come with the official rules as well as
        a fantastic library of artwork, stories and background. Be it the tracking of the inititative, remembering what
        the *** was the name of that npc, finding books or rules or sophisticated processes of rules like gathering
        herbs, summoning creatures, shapeshifting or artifact creation, mundane problems like too far to travel to the
        group, too many children to play (can play from home). No matter what, Foundry brings a solution (or module
        &#x1F609; )<br>
        The possibilities are as endless as the imaginable stories.<br>
        With that in mind we want to honor and thank everyone involved for the great work and plenty of fun playing this
        game.<br>
        Thanks Foundry for a perfect platform to work with. Thanks Ulisses and Ulisses Digital for an ever evolving
        &quot;The Dark Eye&quot; game with all its big features and all those fancy new maps for foundry. Thanks to all
        the voluntary helpers and their efforts (especially VTTom and Nellkir). And finally thanks to all enthusiastic
        players, which enjoy TDE/DSA on Foundry like we do.</p>
    <h2 class="mume-header" id="automation-efforts">Automation efforts</h2>

    <p>Not so long ago we finished the automation update for the last module - Gods of Aventuria 2. This concludes the
        loop for the rework of all modules for this year. We can now celebrate a very long list of automated spells,
        abilities and the like in DSA/TDE. But this is not the end yet &#x1F603; The ever evolving possibilities of new
        effects will be integrated in the next loop too, so each and everyone of us can enjoy roleplaying without being
        distracted by rules.<br>
        If you haven&apos;t migrated your heros in a while, now might be a good time to do so. You can find the
        migration on the character sheet options via the &quot;link&quot; button. This will add all new automation
        effects to your abilities on the sheet.</p>
    <h2 class="mume-header" id="extension-db-news">Extension db news</h2>

    <p>Thanks to Teliogeo, TarionT and especially Rapunzel we have now a whopping amount of more than 1000 automated
        liturgical chant and spell extensions through their work on the DSA/TDE extension db. The extension db is a
        collection of effects which then can be automatically added to official modules.<br>
        We would never have thought that this would be possible at all. Thumbs up for the joint efforts. Feel free have
        a look there and help also, if you want to contribute.<br>

    <p>This (free) modules provides everything that doesn&apos;t quite fit (yet?) into the TDE/DSA system. This might
        include macros, css compatibility fixes for other modules and some minor experimental or contributed functions.
        Feel free to suggest or provide additional functions or features via an issue or a pull request.<br>
